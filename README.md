# Simple ML Projects Using PyTorch

The current project is a refactored version of the PyTorch Tutorial, available at:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html

As this project progresses, I hope to add additional functionality to play around with PyTorch and experiment some of the latest innovations in ML.
